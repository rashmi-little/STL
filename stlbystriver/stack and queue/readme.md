### function related to stack
1. Top is an inbuilt funtion of stack which provides the reference to the top most element.
// pop()
//top()
//size()
//empty()
// push/emplace
These are the most use funciton in stack.
There doesn't exist a clear() in stack.we have to manually delete it by itrating through loop.
Size of empty stack is a garbage value.
if there is no elemt present at stack and we call top function the at runtime   will generate an error segmentation fault.
